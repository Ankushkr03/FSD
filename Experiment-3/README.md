🚀 Implement Routing in Single Page Application (SPA)
📖 Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of client-side routing in a Single Page Application (SPA) using React Router DOM v6.
The application allows seamless navigation between multiple pages such as Home, About, Contact, and Products without refreshing the browser.

It also includes dynamic routing, active navigation links, and a custom 404 error page, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.

This project is developed as part of Experiment 3 – Full Stack II.

To implement navigation between multiple pages

To implement dynamic routes using parameters

To handle invalid routes using a 404 page

🧰 Technologies Used
