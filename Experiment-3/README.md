# 🚀 Implement Routing in Single Page Application (SPA)

## 📖 Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of **client-side routing in a Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React Router DOM v6**.  
The application allows seamless navigation between multiple pages such as Home, About, Contact, and Products without refreshing the browser.

It also includes **dynamic routing**, **active navigation links**, and a **custom 404 error page**, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.

This project is developed as part of **Experiment 3 – Full Stack II**.
